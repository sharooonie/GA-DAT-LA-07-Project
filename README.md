<head> Farmers Market Analysis - Where can you sell your product? </head>

<p> This repo provides supporting information for a proof of concept (POC).  The data product explained by this POC is a recommendation system focused on helping local farmers find the nearest farmers' market with the highest probability to sell their produce.  The program could also help fans of farmers' markets to find the nearest market with product they are seeking. </p> 

1. Problem Formulation

If you were a local baker without a store front, how would you know where to sell your produce?  What you if you had three farmers' markets within 50 miles of you that sold similar products but only one of them never has any stalls for baked goods? How do local farmers without a support system within the U.S. agricultural infrastructure find their way to a farmers' market?

2. Create a Hypothesis

Create a recommendation system that allows the user of the program to determine what type of recommendation they are looking for.  If they are buying, they are looking for the product sold in all of the "drivable" distances.  If they are selling, they are avoiding saturated markets, long distances that may make the early morning drive costly, and successfully active farmers' markets.  

3. Data Analysis & Testing (iterative)

   3a.  Goals

User input*: Key parameters required by the programs' users would be location by means of Zip Code and County, desirable distance for travel and products of interest.  Due to the population the program is intended to interact with, a web-front is needed.  

/u Data Gathering: The USDA maintains the National Farmers' Market Directory.  This file is updated regularly because data input to the dataset is voluntary.  Due to the frequency of data updates, it can be inferred that many farmers' market utilize this dataset for subsidies, marketing and/or advertising.  (As such, it should be expected that this program already has a great deal of competition.)  



*Based on the nature of this POC, these portions of the program has not been built.
